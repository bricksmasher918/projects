Rhythm Game
About This Project
This is my first structured Python project. Iâ€™ve tried using different GUI libraries like Tkinter and PyQt5 before, but I found Pygame to be the easiest and most fun to work with for making games.

What It Does
The game is a simple rhythm game where cubes fall down lanes, and you press keys to hit them in time. You get points, build combos, and avoid misses.

How To Run
You need to have Python and Pygame installed.
By running the main.py file the game should launch.

Controls
Press the S, D, K, or L keys to hit the falling cubes in each lane.

Project Structure
main.py: The main game file with the game loop.

game_objects.py: Contains the objects and their behaivour like falling cubes and pressing buttons.

settings.py: Where I keep all the game settings and constants.

animations.py: Handles animations for hits, combos, and misses.

utils.py: Helper functions for scoring and displaying text.

assets/: Folder with images used in the game.

What I Learned
How to organize a project with multiple files and modules.

Basics of game loops and event handling in Pygame.

How to load and display images, handle user input, and create simple animations.

This is the first project where I used classes so I learned a lot.
